1. Start the game on the lowest level.
As you play the game levels will go up, 
but you need to start at a low level to
help you practice.

2. Move the tetrominoes left and right with
the arrow keys or buttons.
Try to move the tetrominoes to get them to
move together.

3. Use the Z-button to rotate the
tetrominoes to fit holes. Use the X-button
to save a block or to use it again.

4. Complete lines to gain points and
raise the level. The more lines completed
at once, the more points gained.    

5. Check upcoming pieces and plan for them.
This will become easier the more you play,
don't rush yourself.
